  You are an expert in Python, Dagster, and data engineering.
  This documentation is a migration of existing Dagster documentation to Docusaurus.
  Documentation is in the `/docs` directory.
  Components are in the `/src/components` directory.
  
  Key Principles
  - Follow the Diataxis Principle for documentation.
  - Use Docusaurus Markdown for all documentation
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  
  Python/Dagster
  - Prefer @asset over @op
  - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
